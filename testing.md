# Testing

* Minimum **75%** test coverage required to deploy to production
* All tests must **pass** in order to deploy to production
* **@isTest** annotation is put on the class to indicate that it is a test class
* The test classes don't count towards the 3MB org code size limit
* Test methods need to be static and are defined using the testmethod keyword or with the @isTest annotation

```java
static testmethod void myTest() {
    // Add test logic
}
```

or 

```java
static @isTest void myTest() {
    // Add test logic
}
```

* The tests can have only one Test.startTest() and Test.stopTest() block. This block ensures that other setup code in your test doesnâ€™t share the same limits and enables you to test the governor limits.
